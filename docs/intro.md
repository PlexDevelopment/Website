# Welcome to Plex

Plex is a new freedom plugin. It is an alternative to [TotalFreedomMod](https://github.com/TotalFreedomMC/TotalFreedomMod). It has many of the features that make a freedom server unique, but also many features that TotalFreedomMod doesnâ€™t have. For example, there is full support for using a permissions plugin instead of ranks. It is also much more performance oriented. You can use Redis to store punishments and store player data in MongoDB, MariaDB, or SQLite. Plex is also fully customizable as you can change almost all of the messages within the plugin. Plex is not a rewrite or "debloat" of TotalFreedomMod. In fact, it features almost no code from TotalFreedomMod. Plex is an entirely new experience.
