# BukkitTelnet
The BukkitTelnet is a very simple module. The only purpose of the module is to allow admins to automatically log in to telnet without needing to enter the password. If the person's rank is an Admin or above, it will let them connect. If your server is using permissions, you should add the `plex.telnet.autoconnect` to any group you want to have automatically connect to telnet.
