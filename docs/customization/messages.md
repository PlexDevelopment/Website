# Introduction
Almost all of the messages inside of Plex are fully customizable. This page will document how to change messages in the ```messages.yml``` file inside the Plex folder.

## Default file
The default `messages.yml` file is below.
```yaml title=/plugins/Plex/messages.yml# Plex Messages File
# This file uses the MiniMessage system.
# Documentation available at https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage/format.html

# Messages in here will be placed in for certain commands, actions, etc.
# Warning: not all commands have customizable messages

# Variables <v> - these are code-defined replacements for things that should be inserted into messages. (e.g. names, statuses, numbers)
# If any of these variables are supposed to be used within a message, some documentation is provided to give more context to what the variables indicate.
# You are unable to change the order the variables are used due to it being a code-side functionality.
# If you are wishing to change these messages it's recommended you use the same amount of variables as stated in the documentation, however it's not required.

## MiniMessage
The `messages.yml` file uses MiniMessage for coloring messages. For example, writing `<aqua>`, will color the text aqua. This is not like HTML, and you should not close the tag (`</aqua>`). There are some special functions as well, such as `<rainbow>`. The default color will be gray. For a complete guide on using MiniMessage, visit: [https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage/format.html](https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage/format.html).

## Troubleshooting
If you receive `No message.` when executing a command, it is likely you need to regenerate your `messages.yml` file. The default configuration file is also available on [GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlexDevelopment/Plex/master/src/main/resources/messages.yml). As of Plex 0.6 (Beta 6), your `messages.yml` file should automatically update with new entries.
